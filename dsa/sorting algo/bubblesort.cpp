/*
What is stable algorithm ?
If two objects with equal keys appear in the same order in sorted output as they appear in the input,
 an unsorted array of elements then the algorithm used for sorting is a stable sort algorithm
*/
// Check bubblesort is inplace sort or not   it is inplace sort
// Check its stable or not  its stable meaning it preserves the realtive order of the elements
/*
Inplace sort ?
In-Place Sorting algorithm-> A Sorting algorithm which donâ€™t take extra space other than your given array .
It means in a algorithm do not create an array externally to sort an elements ,
then that type of algorithm known as in - place algorithm .
that types algorithms space complexity generally is constant space is required to sort an elements.
